# Hypoterra

**A cool game that may never see the light of day.**

`What I upload to this repository is working in some manner.`

## So I remember:

#### Tile System:

The tile system is based on the window size of `1280x960px` which is defined by the constants `WINDOW_WIDTH` and `WINDOW_HEIGHT`. The tilemap is
a 2 dimensional array consisting of `1200` digits (`40x30`). Every digit represents a `32x32px` area in the window. A `1` represents a stone tile and a `0` represents no
tile. As I continue to add different tiles to the game, different tiles will be represented by other numbers.
